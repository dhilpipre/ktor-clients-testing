# New Relic Ktor Client Testing

This repo provides client apps for testing the five Ktor Client Engines: Apache5, CIO, Java, Jetty and OkHttp   

## How to use 👣

Each client app is designed to make an external call to a website and return the result.  Currently hard coded to ping a local Tomcat instance running the web application from this repository https://github.com/dhilpipre/RandomlySlow-Webapp   

### Running
Easiest way to run each client is to import the project into IntelliJ and run the client using IntelliJ
